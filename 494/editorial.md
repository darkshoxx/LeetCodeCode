Solution
Overview

We are given a list of numbers, nums, and a target value. Our task is to figure out how many ways we can add plus or minus signs in front of the numbers in nums to get the target value, while keeping the order of the numbers the same.

Let's consider an example where nums = [2, 1] and target = 1.

The possible expressions from this are:

    +2 - 1 = 1 → matches the target.
    -2 + 1 = -1 → does not match.
    +2 + 1 = 3 → does not match.
    -2 - 1 = -3 → does not match.

So, there’s only one way (+2 - 1) to get the target value 1.

    Note: We need to use all the elements of the nums array.

Approach 1: Brute Force
Intuition

Start by thinking about how we would manually solve this problem. We would consider each number and decide whether to add it or subtract it. This decision-making process can be modeled using recursion.

We start by defining a recursive function that takes the current index in the list, the current sum of the expression, and the target. For each number, we make two recursive calls: one where we add the number and one where we subtract it.

When we reach the end of the list (i.e., all numbers have been considered), we check if the current sum equals the target. If it does, we increment a counter that tracks the number of valid expressions for that route. We repeat this for every route and find the total number of ways.

While this works for small inputs, it becomes impractical for larger lists due to its exponential time complexity (2n).

Algorithm

    Initialize totalWays to 0 to track the number of ways to reach the target sum.

    Call calculateWays with the initial parameters: nums, currentIndex = 0, currentSum = 0, target, to start the recursive process.

    In the calculateWays function:
        If currentIndex equals the length of nums:
            Check if currentSum matches target:
                If yes, increment totalWays by 1 (a valid way to reach the target sum).
        Otherwise:
            Include the number at currentIndex with a positive sign:
                Recursively call calculateWays with currentIndex + 1 and currentSum + nums[currentIndex].
            Include the current number at currentIndex with a negative sign:
                Recursively call calculateWays with currentIndex + 1 and currentSum - nums[currentIndex].

    Return totalWays after all recursive calls, representing the total number of ways to assign signs to reach the target sum.

Implementation

    Note: The Python3 solution gets a TLE.

Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the input array nums.

    Time complexity: O(2n)

    The function calculateWays is a recursive function that branches out into two recursive calls at each step. This is because each element in the array can either be added or subtracted, leading to 2 choices for each of the n elements.

    This results in a binary tree of recursive calls, where each level of the tree corresponds to a position in the array nums. Since there are n elements in the array, the maximum depth of the recursion tree is n. Therefore, the total number of recursive calls is 2n, leading to a time complexity of O(2n).

    Space complexity: O(n)

    The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursion stack. In the worst case, the recursion stack can go as deep as n levels (one level for each element in the array). Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

Approach 2: Recursion with Memoization
Intuition

Building on the brute force approach, we can say that it has many subproblems that are being solved repeatedly. To understand this redundancy, let's consider a simple example.

Suppose we have the list nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and the target target = 3.

In the brute force approach, we would explore all possible combinations of signs:

    +1 +1 +1 +1 +1
    +1 +1 +1 +1 -1
    +1 +1 +1 -1 +1
    +1 +1 -1 +1 +1
    +1 -1 +1 +1 +1
    -1 +1 +1 +1 +1
    ...

Let's focus on a specific subproblem: reaching a sum of 2 using the first four numbers [1, 1, 1, 1].

    Combination 1: +1 +1 +1 -1 +1
        The sum of the first three numbers is 3.
        The sum of the first four numbers is 2 (since 3 - 1 = 2).

    Combination 2: +1 +1 -1 +1 +1
        The sum of the first three numbers is 1.
        The sum of the first four numbers is 2 (since 1 + 1 = 2).

    Combination 3: +1 -1 +1 +1 +1
        The sum of the first three numbers is 1.
        The sum of the first four numbers is 2 (since 1 + 1 = 2).

In each of these combinations, we encounter the subproblem of reaching a sum of 2 using the first four numbers multiple times. Specifically, the subproblem of reaching a sum of 2 using the first four numbers [1, 1, 1, -1] or [1, 1, -1, 1] is solved repeatedly.

Another example can be given with nums = [a, b, c].

Here is the corresponding recursion tree:

├── (+a)
│   ├── (+b)^
│   │   ├── (+c)
│   │   └── (-c)
│   └── (-b)~
│       ├── (+c)
│       └── (-c)
└── (-a)
    ├── (+b)^
    │   ├── (+c)
    │   └── (-c)
    └── (-b)~
        ├── (+c)
        └── (-c)

As illustrated, the subtrees marked by ^ and ~ are solved twice.

To avoid this redundancy, we introduce a memoization table (a 2D array) where memo[index][currentSum] stores the number of ways to reach the target starting from the index with the currentSum.

Before making recursive calls, we check if the result for the current index and currentSum is already computed. If it is, we return the stored result instead of recalculating it. After computing the result for a given index and currentSum, we store it in the memoization table for future reference.

For example, after calculating the number of ways to reach a sum of 2 using the first four numbers, we store this result in the memoization table. The next time we encounter this subproblem, we simply retrieve the stored result instead of recalculating it. This reduces the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.
Algorithm

    Calculate totalSum, the sum of all elements in the array nums.

    Initialize a 2D array memo of size [nums.length][2 * totalSum + 1] to store intermediate results, and fill it with minimum value to indicate uncomputed states. Possible sums are shifted by totalSum to handle negative indices.

    Call calculateWays with the initial parameters: nums, currentIndex = 0, currentSum = 0, target, and memo.

    In the calculateWays function:

        If currentIndex equals nums.length:
            Check if currentSum equals target:
                Return 1 if they match, as this represents a valid way to reach the target sum.
                Otherwise, return 0.

        If the result for the current state (currentIndex and currentSum) is already computed in memo:
            Return the stored result from memo.

        Recursively calculate the number of ways:
            Add the current number (nums[currentIndex]) to currentSum and call calculateWays for the next index.
            Subtract the current number (nums[currentIndex]) from currentSum and call calculateWays for the next index.

        Store the sum of the results from both recursive calls in memo[currentIndex][currentSum + totalSum] to avoid recomputing.

        Return the stored result from memo.

    Return the result of the initial call to calculateWays, which represents the total number of ways to reach the target sum.

Implementation

    Instead of using the range [−totalSum,+totalSum], which is not possible in an array due to negative indices, we shift the range by adding totalSum to both the lower and upper bounds. This transformation changes the range to [−totalSum+totalSum,totalSum+totalSum], which simplifies to [0,2×totalSum].

Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the input array nums.

    Time complexity: O(n⋅totalSum)

    In the worst case, the function calculateWays is called for each index in the array and each possible sum within the range [−totalSum,totalSum]. Since the sum can range from −totalSum to totalSum, there are 2⋅totalSum+1 possible sums.

    Therefore, the total number of unique states (index, sum) is n×(2⋅totalSum+1). Each state is computed once and stored in the memoization table, leading to a time complexity of O(n⋅totalSum).

    Space complexity: O(n⋅totalSum)

    The space complexity is determined by the memoization table, which has dimensions n×(2⋅totalSum+1). Additionally, the recursion stack can go as deep as n, but this is typically dominated by the space used by the memoization table. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n⋅totalSum).

    The space complexity also includes the space used by the built-in functions, such as computing the sum and filling the rows. However, these operations are linear in terms of the input size and do not significantly affect the overall space complexity, which is dominated by the memoization table.

Approach 3: 2D Dynamic Programming
Intuition

Dynamic programming (DP) is a technique that solves problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. We create a 2D DP table where dp[index][sum] represents the number of ways to reach the sum sum using the first index numbers.

Suppose we have the list nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and the target target = 3.

We initialize the first row of the DP table. For the first number, there is exactly one way to reach the sum equal to the number itself (either by adding or subtracting it). In our example, we initialize dp[0][1 + totalSum] = 1 and dp[0][-1 + totalSum] = 1.

For each subsequent number, we update the DP table based on the previous row. For each possible sum, we add the number of ways to reach that sum by either adding or subtracting the current number. For example, if we are at the second number 1, we update the DP table based on the first row:

    If the previous sum was 0 (i.e., dp[0][0 + totalSum] = 1), we can reach a sum of 1 by adding the current number (1 + 1 = 2) or a sum of -1 by subtracting the current number (1 - 1 = 0).

We continue this process for each number in the list. The value at dp[nums.length - 1][target + totalSum] gives the number of ways to reach the target sum using all numbers. This approach efficiently computes the number of valid expressions by leveraging the results of previously solved subproblems.

The animation below shows how various sums are generated, along with the corresponding indices. The example assumes that the sum values lie in the range of -6 to +6, just for the purpose of illustration.

Current

Algorithm

    Compute totalSum as the sum of all elements in the nums array.

    Initialize a 2D dp array with dimensions [nums.length][2 * totalSum + 1] to represent possible sums shifted by totalSum (to handle negative indices).

    Set up the base case for the first row of the DP table:
        Add 1 to dp[0][nums[0] + totalSum] to account for adding the first number.
        Add 1 to dp[0][-nums[0] + totalSum] to account for subtracting the first number (handle duplicate cases).

    Iterate through the remaining numbers in the nums array:
        For each possible sum sum in the range -totalSum to totalSum:
            If dp[index - 1][sum + totalSum] > 0 (i.e., the sum is achievable from previous numbers):
                Add its value to dp[index][sum + nums[index] + totalSum] (sum achieved by adding the current number).
                Add its value to dp[index][sum - nums[index] + totalSum] (sum achieved by subtracting the current number).

    Check if the absolute value of the target exceeds totalSum:
        If yes, return 0 (the target is unachievable).
        Otherwise, return dp[nums.length - 1][target + totalSum], which contains the number of ways to achieve the target.

Implementation

    Like in the previous approach, we shift the range of possible sums by adding totalSum to both the lower and upper bounds, in order to avoid negative indices.

Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the input array nums.

    Time complexity: O(n⋅totalSum)

    The time complexity is determined by the nested loops in the function. The outer loop runs n times (once for each element in nums), and the inner loop runs 2⋅totalSum+1 times (once for each possible sum from −totalSum to totalSum).

    Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n⋅totalSum).

    Space complexity: O(n⋅totalSum)

    The space complexity is determined by the size of the DP table dp, which is a 2D array of size n×(2⋅totalSum+1). Each entry in the DP table requires constant space, so the total space complexity is O(n⋅totalSum).

    Additionally, the space complexity includes the space required for the input array nums, which is O(n). However, since O(n⋅totalSum) dominates O(n), the overall space complexity is O(n⋅totalSum).

Approach 4: Space Optimized
Intuition

In the previous DP approach, the table dp[index][sum] stores the number of ways to reach the sum sum using the first index numbers. Each entry in the table is calculated based on the entries from the previous row. Specifically, to calculate dp[index][sum], we only need values from the previous row:

    dp[index-1][sum - nums[index]] (subtracting the current number)
    dp[index-1][sum + nums[index]] (adding the current number).

Suppose we have the list nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and the target target = 3.

In the 2D DP table, the calculation for dp[2][3] (number of ways to reach a sum of 3 using the first three numbers) depends on:

    dp[1][3 - 1] (number of ways to reach a sum of 2 using the first two numbers)
    dp[1][3 + 1] (number of ways to reach a sum of 4 using the first two numbers)

This dependency shows that each row in the 2D DP table only depends on the previous row. Once we have calculated the values for dp[index - 1], we no longer need the values from dp[index - 2] or any earlier rows. Thus, instead of maintaining a full 2D table, we update a single array as we process each number in the list.

We initialize the DP array with the first number. For the first number 1, we initialize dp[1 + totalSum] = 1 and dp[-1 + totalSum] = 1.

For each subsequent number, we create a new array and update it based on the previous array. This avoids the need to store the entire 2D table. For each possible sum, we update the new array by adding the number of ways to reach that sum by either adding or subtracting the current number. For example, if we are at the second number 1, we update the new array based on the previous array:

    If the previous sum was 0 (i.e., dp[0 + totalSum] = 1), we can reach a sum of 1 by adding the current number (0 + 1 = 1) or a sum of -1 by subtracting the current number (0 - 1 = -1).

We continue this process for each number in the list. The value at dp[target + totalSum] gives the number of ways to reach the target sum using all numbers.
Algorithm

    Calculate the totalSum as the sum of all elements in the array nums.

    Create a dp array of size 2 * totalSum + 1 to track the number of ways to achieve each possible sum, offset by totalSum to handle negative indices.

    Initialize the first row of the DP table:
        Set dp[nums[0] + totalSum] = 1 for adding the first number.
        Increment dp[-nums[0] + totalSum] by 1 for subtracting the first number (handles duplicates).

    Iterate through the rest of the nums array:
        For each index in nums, create a next array to represent the next state of the DP table.
        For each possible sum in the range [-totalSum, totalSum]:
            If the current sum dp[sum + totalSum] has valid ways:
                Add the number at nums[index] to the current sum and update next[sum + nums[index] + totalSum].
                Subtract the number at nums[index] from the current sum and update next[sum - nums[index] + totalSum].
        Replace dp with next to move to the next state.

    After processing all numbers, check if the target is within the valid range of [-totalSum, totalSum]:
        If the target is out of range, return 0 (no valid ways exist).
        Otherwise, return dp[target + totalSum], which gives the number of ways to achieve the target sum.

    The final result represents the number of ways to assign + or - to elements in nums to achieve the target.

Implementation

    Note: The line dp[-nums[0] + totalSum] += 1 ensures that if the first number is 0, both +0 and -0 are counted as valid sums. This is crucial because for nums[0] = 0, both adding and subtracting 0 result in the sum of 0.

Complexity Analysis

Let n be the size of the input array nums.

    Time complexity: O(n⋅totalSum)

    The algorithm iterates through each element of the array nums once, and for each element, it iterates through all possible sums from −totalSum to totalSum. The totalSum is the sum of all elements in the array nums, which is O(n) in terms of the number of elements.

    Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n⋅totalSum).

    Space complexity: O(2⋅totalSum)

    The space complexity is dominated by the dynamic programming table, which stores values for sums in the range from -totalSum to totalSum. This means the DP table has a size of 2⋅totalSum+1, or O(2⋅totalSum).

    Additionally, there is an extra array next that is used to store the results of the next state, which also requires O(2⋅totalSum) space.

    Thus, the overall space complexity is O(2⋅totalSum).
