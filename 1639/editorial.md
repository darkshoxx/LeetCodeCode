Solution
Overview

We are given a list of equal-length strings, words, and a target string. The task is to count the number of ways we can form the target by selecting characters from words.

To construct the target:

    Start with the first character of target and find a matching character in any of the strings in words.
    For each subsequent character in target, pick characters from higher indices in the strings of words without revisiting previous ones.

    Note: For this problem, we assume that you already know the fundamentals of dynamic programming and are figuring out how to apply it to a wide range of problems, such as this one. If you are not yet at this stage, we recommend checking out our relevant Explore Card content on dynamic programming before coming back to this article.

Approach 1: Top-down Dynamic Programming
Intuition

Let's say we match the first character of target with the first character of a word in words. We then move to the next character in target and search for it in the remaining words. This creates a subproblem where the target becomes shorter by one character, and the search space in words is reduced. We also have the option to skip the current match and search for another match in subsequent words. This branching of choices makes the problem recursive.

The recursion tracks two indices: wordsIndex for the position in words and targetIndex for the position in target.

The base cases are:

    If all characters in target are matched, return 1 (successful match).
    If words is exhausted or the remaining target characters exceed available words, return 0 (no match).

At each step, two options are explored:

    Match the current character: If target[targetIndex] matches any character in words[wordsIndex], recursively proceed with the next character of target and the next word. Contributions from multiple matches are summed.
    Skip the current word: Continue searching with the same target position but move to the next word.

This generates a recursive tree with exponential complexity in the worst case ((numberofwords)target.length), making it inefficient for large inputs.

However, since we have wordsIndex and targetIndex as independent states in the recursion, we can optimize the solution using memoization. The total number of states would remain limited to words.length * target.length. By storing the results of each state in a dp matrix, we can avoid redundant calculations and significantly reduce the time complexity.
Algorithm

Main function - numWays(words, target)

    Initialize the data structures:
        Create a 2D dp array with dimensions [words[0].size()][target.size()] and initialize all values to -1 (used for memoization).
        Create a 2D charFrequency array with dimensions [words[0].size()][26] to store the frequency of characters at each index across all words.

    Populate the charFrequency matrix:
        Iterate over all the words in the words list.
        For each character at index j in each word, increment the corresponding frequency count in charFrequency[j][character].

    Call the recursive function getWords(words, target, 0, 0, dp, charFrequency) to calculate the number of ways to match the target string with the words matrix.

Recursive Function - getWords(words, target, wordsIndex, targetIndex, dp, charFrequency)

    Base case:
        If targetIndex == target.size(), return 1, indicating all characters of the target have been successfully matched.
        If wordsIndex == words[0].size() or there are fewer remaining characters in words than needed by target, return 0, indicating it's not possible to match the target.

    Memoization check:
        If dp[wordsIndex][targetIndex] != -1, return the stored result from the dp array.

    Recursive calculation:
        Initialize countWays = 0.
        Calculate curPos = target[targetIndex] - 'a' to get the target character position.
        Two choices:
            Option 1: Do not match the current character of target with the current word at wordsIndex. Recursively call getWords with wordsIndex + 1 and the same targetIndex.
            Option 2: Match the current character of target with a character at wordsIndex. Multiply the number of valid choices at charFrequency[wordsIndex][curPos] with the result of recursively calling getWords with wordsIndex + 1 and targetIndex + 1.

    Store the calculated countWays in dp[wordsIndex][targetIndex], modulo 1000000007 to avoid overflow.

    Return the value stored in dp[wordsIndex][targetIndex].

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let totalWords be the total number of words in the words matrix, and wordLength and targetLength represent the length of any word in words and the target string, respectively.

    Time Complexity: O(wordLength⋅targetLength+wordLength⋅totalWords)

    We first calculate the frequency of characters in the words matrix, which takes O(wordLength⋅totalWords) time.

    The getWords function is called recursively for each combination of word index and target index, leading to O(wordLength⋅targetLength) recursive calls. Each call involves constant-time operations, and memoization ensures that each combination is computed once, making the recursion time complexity O(wordLength⋅targetLength).

    Thus, the total time complexity is O(wordLength⋅targetLength+wordLength⋅totalWords).

    Space Complexity: O(wordLength⋅targetLength)

    The space complexity is dominated by two factors:

        Memoization (dp table): The dp table stores the intermediate results for every combination of wordIndex and targetIndex. This table has dimensions of wordLength x targetLength, so its space complexity is O(wordLength⋅targetLength).

        Character Frequency Matrix (charFrequency): The charFrequency matrix stores the frequency of each character at each column of the words matrix. This matrix has dimensions of wordLength x 26, where 26 corresponds to the number of possible characters (assuming lowercase English letters), resulting in a space complexity of O(wordLength⋅26), which simplifies to O(wordLength).

    Combining both, the overall space complexity is given by O(wordLength⋅targetLength+wordLength)≈O(wordLength⋅targetLength).

Approach 2: Bottom-up Dynamic Programming
Intuition

Tabulation is a dynamic programming technique that iteratively computes solutions for all combinations of parameters. Unlike memoization, it avoids recursive stack overhead by using a iterative way, making it more efficient. We have two variables that change as we progress through the matrix: the current word index (currWord) and the current target string index (currTarget). To thoroughly explore the combinations, we use two nested loops to iterate through these variables.

First, we establish the base case: if currTarget is 0, then dp[currWord][0] = 1, meaning there is exactly one way to form an empty target string, regardless of the number of columns in words.

Now to achieve the goal we will fill the DP table with two main steps:

    Skip the current column of words:
    Carry over the value from the previous row: dp[currWord][currTarget]=dp[currWord−1][currTarget]
    Include the current character if it matches:
    If target[currTarget - 1] matches a character in the current column of words, add its contribution: dp[currWord][currTarget]+=charFrequency[currWord−1][target[currTarget−1]−′a′]⋅dp[currWord−1][currTarget−1]

Finally, we take the result modulo 109+7 at every step to prevent overflow.

At the end, the total number of ways to form the target string is stored in dp[wordLength][targetLength].
Algorithm

    Create a 2D array charFrequency of size wordLength x 26 to store the frequency of each character at every index in words.
    Fill charFrequency by iterating over each string in words:
        For each string, increment the count of the respective character for the corresponding column.
    Initialize a DP table dp of size (wordLength + 1) x (targetLength + 1) and set all values to 0.
    Set the base case:
        For all currWord from 0 to wordLength, set dp[currWord][0] = 1.
    Iterate currWord from 1 to wordLength:
        Iterate currTarget from 1 to targetLength:
            Set dp[currWord][currTarget] = dp[currWord - 1][currTarget].
            If the character at target[currTarget - 1] matches a character in words at currWord - 1, add the contribution:
            dp[currWord][currTarget]+=charFrequency[currWord−1][target[currTarget−1]−′a′]∗dp[currWord−1][currTarget−1]
            Apply modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow.
    Return the value in dp[wordLength][targetLength].

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let totalWords be the total number of words in the words matrix, and wordLength and targetLength represent the length of any word in words and the target string, respectively.

    Time Complexity: O(wordLength⋅targetLength+wordLength⋅totalWords)

    To find the frequency of all the characters in the words matrix, we iterate through all the characters in the matrix. This takes O(wordLength⋅totalWords) time.

    The dynamic programming table dp is filled by iterating over each combination of word index and target index, leading to a total of O(wordLength⋅targetLength) iterations. Each iteration performs constant-time operations such as looking up values in the charFrequency matrix and updating the dp table.

    Therefore, the total time complexity is given by O(wordLength⋅targetLength+wordLength⋅totalWords).

    Space Complexity: O(wordLength⋅targetLength)

    The space complexity is dominated by two factors:

        dp table: The dp table stores the intermediate results for every combination of wordIndex and targetIndex. This table has dimensions of wordLength x targetLength, so its space complexity is O(wordLength⋅targetLength).

        Character Frequency Matrix (charFrequency): The charFrequency matrix stores the frequency of each character at each column of the words matrix. This matrix has dimensions of wordLength x 26, where 26 corresponds to the number of possible characters (assuming lowercase English letters). The space complexity of this matrix is O(wordLength⋅26), which simplifies to O(wordLength).

    Combining both, the overall space complexity is O(wordLength⋅targetLength).

Approach 3: Optimized Bottom-up Dynamic Programmning
Intuition

From the previous approach, we see that calculating the number of ways to form the target string at position (currWord, currTarget) depends only on two values: (currWord-1, currTarget) and (currWord-1, currTarget-1). This relationship is expressed as:

currCount[currTarget]=currCount[currTarget]+(charFrequency[currWord−1][target[currTarget−1]−′a′]⋅prevCount[currTarget−1])modMOD

Here:

    currCount[currTarget] accumulates the count of ways to form the target string up to currTarget.
    charFrequency[currWord-1][target[currTarget-1] - 'a'] gives the frequency of the current target character in the previous word.
    prevCount[currTarget-1] provides the count of ways to form the target string up to the previous position before the current update.

This relationship ensures that each character from the target is considered while accounting for its frequency in the available words.

Using this insight, we can optimize the 2D DP table to a 1D array currCount, where each element represents the ways to form the target string up to a specific index. To manage the dependency on values from the previous row, we maintain an additional variable, prevCount, which temporarily stores the value of currCount before it is updated in the current iteration. Once all iterations are complete, the result is stored in currCount[target.length()].
Algorithm

    Create a 2D array charFrequency of size wordLength x 26 to store the frequency of each character at every index in words. Iterate over each string in words, and for each string, increment the count of the respective character for the corresponding column in charFrequency.
    Initialize two DP arrays: prevCount and currCount. Both arrays are of size targetLength + 1, and are initially set to 0. Set prevCount[0] = 1 because there is one way to form an empty target string.
    Iterate currWord from 1 to wordLength:
        Copy the values from prevCount to currCount to carry over the previous row.
        Iterate currTarget from 1 to targetLength:
            First, carry over the previous value without using the current column of words by setting currCount[currTarget] = prevCount[currTarget].
            Then, if the character at target[currTarget - 1] matches a character in words at currWord - 1, add the contribution from charFrequency[currWord - 1][target[currTarget - 1] - 'a'] * prevCount[currTarget - 1] to currCount[currTarget].
            Apply modulo 10^9 + 7 to the result to prevent overflow.
            After processing each currWord, copy the values of currCount to prevCount for the next iteration.
    Finally, return the value in currCount[targetLength], which stores the number of ways to form the target string using the entire words matrix.

Implementation
Complexity Analysis

Let totalWords be the total number of words in the words matrix, and wordLength and targetLength represent the length of any word in words and the target string, respectively.

    Time Complexity: O(wordLength⋅targetLength+wordLength⋅totalWords)

    To find the frequency of all the characters in the words matrix, we iterate through all the characters in the matrix. This takes O(wordLength⋅totalWords) time.

    The dynamic programming arrays prevCount and currCount are filled by iterating over each combination of word index and target index, leading to a total of O(wordLength⋅targetLength) iterations. Each iteration performs constant-time operations such as looking up values in the charFrequency matrix and updating the dp table.

    Therefore, the total time complexity is given by O(wordLength⋅targetLength+wordLength⋅totalWords).

    Space Complexity: O(wordLength⋅targetLength)

    The space complexity is dominated by two factors:

    The dp arrays prevCount and currCount: These arrays store the results for every combination of wordIndex and targetIndex. Each array has a size of (targetLength+1), so their space complexity is O(targetLength).

    Character Frequency Matrix (charFrequency): The charFrequency matrix stores the frequency of each character at each column of the words matrix. This matrix has dimensions of wordLength x 26, where 26 corresponds to the number of possible characters (assuming lowercase English letters). The space complexity of this matrix is O(wordLength⋅26), which simplifies to O(wordLength).

    Combining both, the overall space complexity is O(wordLength⋅targetLength).
