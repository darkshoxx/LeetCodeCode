Proposition:
Given a string s and an integer k>0, it is possible to
create k palindrome strings from all letters of s if and only if:
i) k <= len(s)
ii) #odd letters in s <= k
Proof
=>
i) is trivial, otherwise there's be empty words
ii) assume #odd > k. The only way an odd-lettered letter 
can be part of a palindrome is in the middle, and there
are at most k middle letters to be filled. contradiction
if #odd > k
<= construction: place one of each odd numbered letters
at the center of a total of #odd letters <= k words
while there are more than 1 empty words, fill their 
center with a letter each of a pair of even letters
this must work because of i)
You are then left with at least one more even-lettered
pair (l,l) . if there's still an empty word: make 
the word "ll".
for the remaining even pairs, wrap them around any word.
